## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I need to continue working on my positioning knowledge and skills. I feel that I have used too much CSS for this, and so will continue to revise how I accomplish the styling to ensure that it is as accurate and efficient as possible.
